# ClassGameIdea

Here are a few of the ideas that I have - I will expand on these later.

Spongebob Adventure game: You can pick a character from Spongebob Squarepants, and you go about doing different levels of varying difficulty across the bikini bottom floor. This invovles making patties, stealing stuff, fighgting, etc. Basic adventure/action game.

HW LIFE: I really like the idea that we should as a class make a HW specific game. You are a student at HW, and your goal is to gain enough credits to graduate. You go about your day, navigating a semi-realistic HW school. This involves eating, class, studying, tests, social situations, etc. You earn points for various things, you have challenges, etc. We could achieve this as a class by coding the database for each player profile, and having methods for the different things you go about doing. We would also need to code the world itself, which would be a substantial undertaking.

here's an outline of how to code the HW LIFE (DEFINITELY did not use chatGPT)

Creating a game like "HW LIFE" where you play as a student at a school and aim to earn credits to graduate is a complex project that involves several components. Here's a brief outline of how you might go about coding this game:

Concept and Design:

Define the game concept and mechanics, including what actions players can take, what events can occur, and how players earn credits.
Design the game world, including the school layout, characters, and the daily routine.
Choose a Programming Language and Tools:

Select a programming language and development environment for your game. Common choices for game development include Python, JavaScript, Unity, or a game engine like Unreal Engine or Godot.
Database Structure:

Design a database to store player profiles. You'll need tables to store player data such as credits earned, items collected, challenges completed, and progress.
Player Profile Management:

Create methods to manage player profiles, including creating new profiles, saving progress, and loading profiles.
Game World Development:

Develop the virtual school environment, including classrooms, cafeteria, library, dorms, and other locations.
Design the game world's visuals, assets, and interactive elements.
Implement navigation for the player character within the school.
Game Mechanics and Actions:

Create methods and functions for various actions, such as attending classes, studying, taking tests, eating, and socializing.
Implement systems for earning and spending credits based on player actions and decisions.
Challenges and Goals:

Develop a system for creating challenges or missions that players can complete to earn credits.
Implement goals or achievements to motivate players and add depth to the gameplay.
User Interface (UI):

Design and code the game's user interface, including menus, status bars, and notification systems.
Testing and Debugging:

Thoroughly test the game to identify and fix bugs, glitches, and balance issues.
Consider beta testing with a group of players to gather feedback and make improvements.
Art and Sound:

Create or obtain art assets for characters, objects, and the game environment.
Incorporate sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
Deployment:

Prepare the game for deployment on your chosen platform, whether it's a web-based game, mobile app, or desktop application.
Documentation:

Create documentation or in-game tutorials to help players understand the game's mechanics and objectives.
Publish and Promote:

If desired, publish the game on relevant platforms (app stores, websites, etc.).
Promote the game to your target audience, which in this case could be your class.
Remember that a project of this scope can be quite ambitious, especially if it involves a class collaboration. It's important to break down the development into manageable tasks and consider the skills and resources available within your class. Collaboration tools and version control systems may be helpful for managing the project among multiple contributors.
