# ClassGameIdea

Here are a few of the ideas that I have - I will expand on these later.

Spongebob Adventure game: You can pick a character from Spongebob Squarepants, and you go about doing different levels of varying difficulty across the bikini bottom floor. This invovles making patties, stealing stuff, fighgting, etc. Basic adventure/action game.

HW LIFE: I really like the idea that we should as a class make a HW specific game. You are a student at HW, and your goal is to gain enough credits to graduate. You go about your day, navigating a semi-realistic HW school. This involves eating, class, studying, tests, social situations, etc. You earn points for various things, you have challenges, etc. We could achieve this as a class by coding the database for each player profile, and having methods for the different things you go about doing. We would also need to code the world itself, which would be a substantial undertaking.
